# Home_Sales

Please Note: I wasn't sure exactly how I was supposed to calculate task 5: "The view rating for the average price for homes that are greater than or equal to $350,000". I consulted with a Learning Assistant and he advised me to do it the way I did it in scenario 1. However, I was a bit skeptical because the assignment has me partition based on date_built so I thought that should be a part of the query. Therefore, I created a second scenario (scenario 2) where I have a query that incorporates date_built.
